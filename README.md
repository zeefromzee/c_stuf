# Beginner C Projects â™¡â‚ŠËš ðŸ¦¢ãƒ»â‚Šâœ§â‹†â­’Ëšï½¡â‹†

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly **C programming projects**!  
This repository is where I practice, learn, and experiment with C by building small, hands-on programs.  

Each project is simple, but they cover important concepts like loops, conditionals, arrays, functions, and working with standard libraries.

##  Projects Included
Some of the projects youâ€™ll find here:
- **Rock, Paper, Scissors** â€“ A fun command-line game against the computer
- **Hangman Game**- A fun way to pass your time by guessing words
- **Snakes and Ladders** - For people who do like my codes, I'd suggest avoiding this one

(*More projects are being added as I keep learning!*)
