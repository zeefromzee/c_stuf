# Beginner C Projects ♡₊˚ 🦢・₊✧⋆⭒˚｡⋆

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly **C programming projects**!  
This repository is where I practice, learn, and experiment with C by building small, hands-on programs.  

Each project is simple, but they cover important concepts like loops, conditionals, arrays, functions, and working with standard libraries.
